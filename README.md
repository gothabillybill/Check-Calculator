# check-calculator

This is a script that prompts the user to input checks, the amount of money written on each check, and whether or not the check was cashed. 
The script then computes the user's full account balance and bank account balance.

The purpose of this script was to demonstrate an understanding of classes and how to overload operators in C++ for an NYU programming course.
